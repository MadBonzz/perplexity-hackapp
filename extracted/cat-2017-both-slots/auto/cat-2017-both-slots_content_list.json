Where humans are unique, though, with the possible exception of honeybees, is that we try to communicate this understanding the world with others. We have along history of doing this by drawing maps – the earliest version yet discovered were scrawled on cave walls 14,000 years ago.

In fact, for much of human history, north almost never appeared at the top, according to Jerry Brotton, a map historian… “North was rarely put at the top for the simple fact that north is where darkness comes from,” he says. “West is also very unlikely o be put at the top because west is where the sun disappears.” ",

Early Chinese compasses were actually oriented to point south, which was considered to be more desirable than deepest darkest north. But  in Chinese maps, the emperor, who lived in the north of the country was always put at the top of the map, with everyone else, his loyal subjects, looking up towards him. “In Chinese culture the Emperor looks south because it’s where the winds come from, it’s a good direction. North is not very good but you are in a position of the subjection to the emperor, so you look up to him,” says Brotton. ",

Near a 13th-century cathedral in this Swiss city on the shores of a lovely lake, I found what I was looking for: a Gutenberg printing press. \"This was the Internet of its day — at least as influential as the iPhone,\" said Gabriel de Montmollin, the director of the Museum of the Reformation, toying with the replica of Johann Gutenberg's great invention. [Before the invention of the printing press] it used to take four monks...up to a year to produce a single book. With the advance in movable type in 15th-century Europe, one press could crank out 3,000 pages a day. Before long, average people could travel to places that used to be unknown to them — with maps! Medical information passed more freely and quickly, diminishing the sway of quacks...The printing press offered the prospect that tyrants would never be able to kill a book or suppress an idea. Gutenberg's brainchild broke the monopoly that clerics had on scripture. And later, stirred by pamphlets from a version of that same press, the American colonies rose up against a king and gave birth to a nation. ",

If two cars go through A-M and one is directed to go through M-N, one of the cars which was directed to go through A-N can break the police order and go through A-M-B and save time as follows:   \nOriginal time $( A - N { - } B ) = 2 1 + 1 2 = ( t h r e e c a r s ) = 3 3$   \nNew time $= 1 2 \\left( 3 \\thinspace c a r s \\right) + 2 0 . 9 = 3 2 . 9$   \nThe police department cannot direct both cars to go through M-N as in that case all four cars would go through N-B   \nIn case three cars are directed to go through A-M, either one car can be directed through M-N or two cars can be directed through M-N.   \nIf one car is directed through M-N, one of the two cars directed through M-B, can break the police order and go through M-N, and save time as shown.   \nOriginal time $\\left( A { - } M { - } B \\right) = 1 2 \\left( 3 c a r s \\right) + 2 0 . 9 = 3 2 . 9$   \nNew time $( A { - } M { - } N { - } B ) = 1 2 + 8 + 1 2 = 3 2$ minutes.   \n∴ two cars must be directed through M-N such that any car breaking the police order cannot reduce the travel time.

More accurately, the stability of the subnivium depends on the interaction between snow depth and snow density. Imagine being under a stack of blankets that are all flattened and pressed together. When compressed, the blankets essentially form one compacted layer. In contrast, when they are lightly placed on top of one another, their insulative capacity increases because the air pockets between them trap heat. Greater depths of low-density snow are therefore better at insulating the ground. ",

Research has shown that the snow season (the period when snow is more likely than rain) has become shorter since 1970. When rain falls on snow, it increases the density of the snow and reduces its insulative capacity. Therefore, even though winters are expected to become warmer overall from future climate change, the subnivium will tend to become colder and more variable with less protection from the above-ground temperatures.

In field experiments, researchers removed a portion of the snow cover to investigate the importance of the subnivium's insulation.

A team of researchers from Denmark and the U.K. hoped to identify the species of animal to which the antlers once belonged by analyzing collagen proteins in the samples and comparing them across the animal kingdom, Laura Geggel reports for LiveScience. Somewhat surprisingly, molecular analysis of the artifacts revealed that some combs and other material had been carved from reindeer antlers.... Given that reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) don't live in Denmark, the researchers posit that it arrived on Viking ships from Norway. Antler craftsmanship, in the form of decorative combs, was part of Viking culture. Such combs served as symbols of good health, Geggel writes. The fact that the animals shed their antlers also made them easy to collect from the large herds that inhabited Norway. ",

Archaeologists had suspected that the Vikings had experience with long maritime voyages [that] might have preceded their raiding days.

When pecked by a bird, the caterpillars whistle by compressing their bodies like an accordion and forcing air out through specialized holes in their sides.

The definitions can seem to ensure and fix the meaning of words, just as the gold standard can back a country's currency.\" What Wittgenstein found in the circulation of ordinary language, however, was a free-floating currency of meaning.

It cannot be 1 since the tea from Ooty is not in Cup 6.   \nFrom (5), the rating of the tea in Cup 2 can either be 2 or 4. Any other even number below 10 cannot  be assigned to it since there are five other cups in which the tea has been rated from 1 to 10 and all the ratings are distinct numbers.   \nIf the rating of the tea in Cup 2 is 4, the minimum possible rating for the tea in Cup 5 will be 5 and from that, the rating of the tea in Cup 3 will be 10. But 10 is the highest rating and it is not given to the tea in Cup 3 (from (2)).   \nTherefore, the tea in Cup 2 has a rating of 2.   \nThe only rating that can be given to the tea  n Cup 5 is 3. (Since it cannot be an even number and it has to be less than 5). Therefore, the rank of the tea in Cup 5 will be 5 with a rating of 3. Hence, the rating of the tea in Cup 3 will be 6.   \nBetween the ratings 3 and 6, only one rating is possible i.e. 5, because there are only two even ratings that are given to the tea in Cup 3 and Cup 2. Also, the tea in Cup 1 has a less rating than the tea in Cup 3. So the only possibility is that the tea in Cup 1 has a rating of 5 and is ranked fourth and the tea in Cup 3 has a rating of 6 and is ranked third.   \nFrom (1), only the tea which has got the second highest rating can belong to Himachal and  t is the tea in Cup 6. Therefore, the tea from Himachal is in Cup 6 and it has the second highest rating. The rating has to be an odd number greater than 6 and less than 10. The only number possible is 7. If it were 9, then the tea from Ooty has to be given a rating of 10 but there are only two even ratings. Hence, the tea from Himachal has got a rating of 7.   \nThe tea from Ooty will be in Cup 4. The rating of the tea from Ooty should be an odd number greater than 7 and less than 10. The only possible value is 9.   \nThe final table will be as follows: ",
